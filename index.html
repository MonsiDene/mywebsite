        <h2>About me </h2>
        <p>
           I am an engineer who travels by train
        </p>
        <h2>What i'm working on</h2>
        <p>
         I don't like new trains because they don't have hooks, so with the power of my prusa 3D printer I want to fill all the trains with my 3D printed hooks.
If you believe in the power of open source all the projets are available on this site if you want to download and print them too, let's make the trains more comfortable because a team of engineers couldn't do it.
If you want to buy me a coffee I'm grateful, I'm getting by on that lately. 
Thank you <3
